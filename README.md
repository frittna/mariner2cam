🔴 **Mariner 2 Cam Timelapse (Pi Zero 2)**
🔴 [github.com/frittna/mariner2cam/edit/mariner2cam-timelapse](https://github.com/frittna/mariner2-cam-timelapse) - 14:39-24.July.2026+AI copilot

This is the timelapse-focused variant of my Mariner 2 Cam fork.
It keeps the base Mariner workflow, but adds a print-timelapse video function and several small improvements.

## What is different in this version

- Timelapse sessions with video rendering (25/30/60 fps presets)
- Optional skip-frames rendering for long prints*    *to-fix
- UV-bottom trigger mode only (`uv_light`) for more stable captures
- MediaMTX live camera profile switching (HIGH/MID/LOW)
- Better serial/status resilience during print polling
- Better UI feedback for file actions and upload, cancel a print and rendering a video
- Temperautre sensor display added (°C/°F with BMP280 I2C)
- Offline indicator when page open but host not reachable
- slice file limit raised to 1GB files
  

## Timelapse method used

The earlier Z-top trigger experiments were too jitter-prone in real use.
This version uses UV-bottom triggering instead (3.3V signal to `GPIO24`, no internal pull-up), which gives more reliable capture timing during real print exposure phases.

For this i use a small opto-coupler board to convert the UV-Light_FAN connector signal on my Mars 3 printer mainboard to 3.3V.

Btw: The lables on my original printer mainboard were mixed up (printed wrong) so if you get confused try the MB-Fan connector instead when you play around with the printable config file to set them up how they shoud act.

Also, frame grabbing now runs as a buffered/background process while a session is active, instead of repeatedly starting/stopping per trigger.

Some technical details ➡️ **[Timelapse + MediaMTX details](docs/TIMELAPSE_MEDIAMTX_SETUP.md)**

## Hardware / runtime notes

- Use an external **5V / 1.5A+** PSU for the Pi.
- High profile streaming and capture can keep CPU load elevated for long time so active cooling is recommended.
- A complete guide to load it straigt from github will follow i guess but i can't make these things because i dont know how to do it properly. But you can find a long detailed instruciton how to install Mariner 2 Cam on top of amd989's wonderful Mariner2 version with his install script. Then update and create all new files from my mariner2cam-timelapse fork which are newer than April'26, compile the frontend and copy the frontend/dist folder over again.

🔴 Mariner 2 Cam for Pi Zero 2

### 3D-Printer Monitoring Tool with Camera Support, WLAN OTG-USB-Gadget, Firewall, VPN, Fail2ban, Webmin and a physical shutdown  ###
**Status:** Work-in-progress, but working stable and fine now. I went through all the steps in my guide again from a fresh install to test it.

You will need a external power adapter for you Pi for sure and be careful that you not run into the double-power problem of your pi+printer.

>**Chitobox-Note:** The ctb decryption from amd989 had to be modified a bit to work on new `.ctb` files (is it a bug or caused by a Chitobox update?).

### 📖 Complete Installation Guide & Code

A tested full step-by-step guide to make a fresh Zero 2 W installation can be found here.
You can run it yourself by following this tutorial in 1-2 hours.

* **Note for Pi Zero 1.1:** There is a separate instruction for the Zero 1.1 which was *NOT COMPATIBLE* at the beginning with today's automatic scripts. But the Zero 1 is weak and I sold it, so it will not have the same state of progress. If you want to run it on the Zero 1, see the file: `"Anleitung - Mariner2 - PI Zero W 1.1+2 outdated (ARM6).txt"`.
